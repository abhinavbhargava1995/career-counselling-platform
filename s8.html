          <p>Indian Railways, the world's fourth largest railway network, requires a variety of people at the administrative, technical and non technical operations, to work together for its smooth functioning. Besides the gazetted posts that falls under Group A and group B, there are Group C and D employees comprising of clerical staff, supervisors, skilled labour etc. Railway Ticket Collector is a group C level post in railway service and for applying to this post, one should have at least passed 10th standard. </p>

          <p>Railway Ticket Collector (Abbr. TC), most commonly known as TTE (Travelling Ticket Examiner)/ TTI (Traveling Ticket Inspector) is one among the front line staff of Indian Railways having a first level interface with the passengers. They are the people who ensure that every passenger in the train is traveling with a valid ticket of appropriate denomination. It is the ticket collector's responsibility to collect fine if someone is traveling without ticket. </p>

          <p>Passengers traveling without tickets will cause a big loss to the governments exchequer, as Indian Railway has a capacity of transporting seventeen million passengers every day. So it is the responsibility of Ticker Checker's to take care of any kind of loss occurring to the department because of the travelers without ticket.</p>
          
          <p>The job of a TTE involves, to be in-charge of a reserved coach, guiding passengers, checking ticket in an unreserved coach or at the platform, manning the inquiry counter at Railway station etc. It is a job which demands hard work and flexibility to follow difficult time schedules. Several bad elements will occur within the train, and so a ticket collector should have the courage and strength to handle such situations. The personal attributes required for TC's are discipline, patience, responsibility, punctuality, commitment, honesty, courage and above all self-confidence.</p>
